Simple Tic-Tac-Toe project, but I overhauled it with my own pixel art design and polishing!

Polishing:
  - Created a really simple shader to scroll a background. I could have done it without a shader, but I did it to learn Unity shaders.
  - "Waiting" animation while the bot is deciding it's turn
  - Various animations/particle effects applied to the buttons
